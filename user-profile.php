					<h4>About Me</h4>
					<p>I feel very strongly about animal welfare, I'm vegetarian too because I can't bear the thought of eating animals.</p>

					<p>I'm most passionate about rescuing animals and helping them get better - particularly dogs - and I help out with rescues and have adopted 'problem' dogs and worked with them. Animal cruelty has a very profound effect on me and I get deeply upset by it. </p>

					<p>I was really lucky to spend some time with a speaker from the Dr Hadwen Trust when I was at uni - the charity that work on alternatives to animal testing. I learned so much from them and I wish more animal rights groups could be more like them.</p>
